A shell is an important part of an operating system, serving as an interface between the user and the system's kernel. The command-line interface (CLI) interprets and executes commands entered by the user. In essence, a shell acts as a mediator, enabling users to interact with the operating system by entering text-based commands. Which the shell then processes and turns into instructions that the system understands. Its primary function involves parsing user input, executing system commands, managing processes, handling file operations, controlling communication between the user and the system resources. Solidifying the shell as a pivitol compenent to bridge the gap between sytem and user.
